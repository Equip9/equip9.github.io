Adding a WiFi Shield to your Arduino may not be [that](http://www.cooking-hacks.com/index.php/xbee-wifi-module-for-arduino-digi-official.html) [expensive](http://www.cooking-hacks.com/index.php/wifi-module-for-arduino-roving-rn-xvee-xbee-compatible.html), but I'm sure you have plenty of old hardware ready to be reused. Good news is that if you want to use an [Airport Express](http://www.apple.com/airport-express/) with your [Ethernet Shield](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield) you can use the USB port to power your Arduino board **without** having to use an **external power supply**.
